# CrewAI-Bash-Scripting-Expert-agents

This repository contains an example of an Agile development process using CrewAI. The project demonstrates how to use CrewAI to manage tasks, assign roles, and collaborate on a software development project.

Project Overview
The project aims to develop a Bash script wrapper function that provides enhanced operational efficiency and reliability. The wrapper will execute commands with parameters, log execution information, manage errors, and output results to stdout.

Agile Methodology
The project follows an Agile methodology, with the following roles:

Product Owner: Responsible for defining user stories and ensuring the project aligns with market demands.
Developer: Implements the requirements outlined in the user stories through coding.
Reviewer: Reviews the code to assess quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
CrewAI Implementation
The project uses CrewAI to manage the workflow and collaboration between the different roles. CrewAI allows for:

Task management: Defining and assigning tasks to different agents.
Role-based collaboration: Assigning specific roles to agents with relevant expertise.
Process automation: Automating the workflow between different tasks and agents.
Project Files
The project includes the following files:

agile.py: The main script that defines the agents, tasks, and crew.
requirements.txt: The required Python libraries for the project.
Running the Project
To run the project, follow these steps:

Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main script: python agile.py
Output
The project will generate a report with the results of each task. The report will include:

User stories defined by the Product Owner.
Bash script code developed by the Developer.
Code review report generated by the Reviewer.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how CrewAI can be used to manage an Agile development process. By using CrewAI, teams can improve collaboration, automate workflows, and ensure high-quality software delivery.
